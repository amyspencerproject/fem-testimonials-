## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Chose to use CSS Grid as the layout for this challenge. The design has both rows and columns.
-

### Continued development

Thinking in CSS Grid is still difficult for me. There is another challenge on my list that Grace suggested was a good exercise for using Grid. I just need more practice.

### Useful resources

- [Autofill on Columns](https://css-tricks.com/an-auto-filling-css-grid-with-max-columns/) - I didn't use this for the final solution but it was an interesting read
